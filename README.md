# BFS-and-DFS-Algorithms
Breadth First Search and Depth First Search implementation in python.

### BFS Algorithm

The steps of the algorithm work as follow:

     1.Start by putting any one of the graphâ€™s vertices at the back of the queue.
     2.Now take the front item of the queue and add it to the visited list.
     3.Create a list of that vertex's adjacent nodes. 
      Add those which are not within the visited list to the rear of the queue.
     4.Keep continuing steps two and three till the queue is empty.

### DFS Algorithm

The DSF algorithm follows as:

    1.We will start by putting any one of the graph's vertex on top of the stack.
    2.After that take the top item of the stack and add it to the visited list of the vertex.
    3.Next, create a list of that adjacent node of the vertex. 
      Add the ones which aren't in the visited list of vertexes to the top of the stack.
    4.Lastly, keep repeating steps 2 and 3 until the stack is empty.
